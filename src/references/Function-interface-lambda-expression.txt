If lambdas were translated to anonymous inner classes, you’d have one new class file for each lambda. 
As each anonymous inner class would be loaded it would take up room in the JVM’s meta-space (which is
 the Java 8 replacement for the Permanent Generation). If the code inside each such anonymous inner 
 class is compiled to machine code by the JVM, it would be stored inside a code cache. In addition, 
 these anonymous inner classes would be instantiated into separate objects. As a consequence, 
 anonymous inner classes would increase the memory consumption of your application. It is potentially 
 helpful to introduce a caching mechanism in order to reduce all of this memory overhead, which 
 motivates the introduction of some kind of abstraction layer.
